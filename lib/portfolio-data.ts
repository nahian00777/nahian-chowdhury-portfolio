  description: [
    `I'm a Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate with a strong interest in graduate-level study (MS/PhD) and 
    research in machine learning and computer vision.`,

    `My current academic and research work focuses on image-based learning, including caricature generation, where 
    I explore deep learning methods for representation learning and visual transformation. I've gained hands-on 
    experience applying deep learning techniques in practical, research-oriented settings.`,

    `Over the past few years, I've built a strong foundation in algorithms and data structures through competitive 
    programming—solving 1500+ algorithmic problems across platforms like Codeforces (Specialist), LeetCode 
    (Top 13.82%), and CodeChef (3★). I've also represented my university in multiple national-level programming 
    contests, which has strengthened my ability to reason rigorously and perform under pressure.`,

    `Alongside my research interests, I bring a solid software engineering background with hands-on experience in 
    backend development using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. This allows me to translate research ideas into 
    scalable and maintainable systems.`,

    `I am actively seeking research-oriented MS or PhD opportunities where I can contribute to applied machine 
    learning systems while further developing my expertise in computer vision and deep learning.`
